### Backend Implementation (100% COMPLETE)
1. **Database Setup**
   - Created PostgreSQL 'garden' database
   - Configured Sequelize for PostgreSQL (was MySQL)
   - Created Order model with 7 JSONB columns
   - Created and ran all migrations
   - Added GIN indexes for JSONB performance

2. **Authentication System**
   - JWT-based authentication middleware
   - Auth routes: register, login, me, change-password
   - Password hashing with bcryptjs
   - Protected route middleware

3. **Order CRUD API**
   - Full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Additional endpoints: status update, lock/unlock
   - Pagination and search functionality
   - Audit logging in JSONB format
   - 12 total API endpoints created

4. **Workflow Documentation**
   - Established clear workflow commands:
     - `continue garden` - Start/resume work
     - `save progress` - Save state before ending
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with workflow protocol
   - Fixed PROGRESS.md to reflect actual progress (30%)
   - Created session management scripts

## üöß Currently In Progress
- Ready to start frontend development
- No incomplete tasks from this session

## üìã What Needs to Be Done Next

### IMMEDIATE Priority (Next Session)
1. **React App Structure Setup**
   - Clean up Vite template boilerplate
   - Install React Router and Zustand
   - Create folder structure (components, pages, hooks, utils)
   - Set up routing

2. **Create AppShell Layout Component**
   - Three-column layout matching Qualia
   - Dark theme (bg-gray-900)
   - Responsive design

3. **Convert basic-info.html to React**
   - First component conversion
   - Test the workflow

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Backend Configuration
- Backend runs on port **3002** (not 3001 - that's in use by another app)
- Database: PostgreSQL with user 'macbook'
- All JSONB columns properly configured with indexes

### What Changed
- Switched from MySQL to PostgreSQL for JSONB support
- Backend port changed from 3001 to 3002
- Established official workflow commands

## üí° Context for Next Session

When starting the next Claude session, type:
```
continue garden
```

Claude will:
1. Read all tracking files
2. See backend is 100% complete
3. See frontend is 0% complete  
4. Continue with React setup as the next task

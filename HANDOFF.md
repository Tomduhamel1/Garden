## üìã What Needs to Be Done Next

### IMMEDIATE Priority (Next Session)
1. **Continue Schema-to-UI Wiring (35 components remaining)**

- **100% Frontend Components Complete (44 total)**
- **All menu items functional**
- **All routes properly configured**
- **Consistent dark theme throughout**

### Critical Reminders
- ALL components use dark theme (bg-gray-900) consistently
- Components inside AppShell use proper section structure
- ALL data-schema-key attributes preserved for backend integration
- LoanCalculations and LoanDisclosures now properly integrated

### Recent Bug Fixes
- Fixed ApTable.tsx syntax error
- Fixed LoanDisclosures layout to match other components

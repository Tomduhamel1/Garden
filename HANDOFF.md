**Last Session**: 2025-08-19 10:31 PST
**Session Duration**: ~7 minutes
**Progress**: 33% Complete

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished This Session

### Navigation Sidebar Implementation
1. **AppShell Component Created**
   - Implemented comprehensive navigation sidebar with ALL 35+ menu items
   - Dark theme (bg-gray-800/900) matching HTML prototypes
   - Collapsible sections with chevron icons
   - Active page highlighting with blue background and left border
   - Complete menu structure:
     - ORDER: General (7 items), Title (4 items)
     - CLOSING: Charges (11 items with section badges A-N)
     - Disclosures (7 items with page numbers)
     - Proceeds (2 items)
     - TASKS: Documents, Accounting, Marketplace
     - INTEGRATIONS: Envelopes & Shipping, Recording
     - PREVIEW: Closing Disclosure, Settlement Statement
   - Order header with stats (Notes, Tasks, Automations, Activity)
   - All navigation properly linked with React Router

2. **Fixed BasicInfo Component**
   - Removed duplicate sidebar (was rendering its own)
   - Converted from light theme to dark theme (bg-gray-900)
   - Now properly works with AppShell layout
   - Returns only main content and right rail using React Fragment
   - All form inputs updated to dark theme styling

## üöß Currently In Progress
- Frontend development phase
- 2/35 components complete (AppShell navigation + BasicInfo)
- Navigation sidebar is now the centerpiece of the application

## üìã What Needs to Be Done Next

### IMMEDIATE Priority (Next Session)
1. **Convert contacts.html to React**
   - Create src/components/orders/Contacts.tsx
   - Must work with AppShell (no duplicate sidebar)
   - Use dark theme (bg-gray-900)
   - Include all borrower/seller fields

2. **Convert loan.html to React**
   - Create src/components/orders/Loan.tsx
   - Must work with AppShell (no duplicate sidebar)
   - Use dark theme
   - Include all loan terms and lender information

3. **Convert remaining high-priority prototypes**
   - origination-charges.html
   - did-shop-for.html  
   - did-not-shop-for.html
   - All must use dark theme and work with AppShell

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Critical Lessons Learned
- **HTML prototypes are the source of truth** - must convert EXACTLY
- User spent significant time creating 35+ detailed prototypes
- Do NOT create simplified versions - include EVERY field
- Three-column layout is provided by AppShell + component
- **DARK THEME** (bg-gray-900) is the correct theme
- Components should NOT render their own sidebar - AppShell provides it
- Components return main content + right rail only

### Tailwind v4 Setup
- Using @import "tailwindcss" instead of @tailwind directives
- PostCSS config uses @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
- All color classes (gray-50 through gray-900) now working
- Width classes (w-72, w-64) properly generated

### Current Dev Server
- Frontend running on http://localhost:5173
- Backend running on port 3002
- BasicInfo accessible at /orders/1/basic-info

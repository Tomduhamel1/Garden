## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished This Session

### Frontend React Setup
1. **React App Structure**
   - Cleaned up Vite template boilerplate
   - Installed React Router, Zustand, and Axios
   - Created folder structure (components/orders, pages, hooks, utils, store, services, types)
   - Set up routing with React Router v7

2. **Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration**
   - Fixed Tailwind v4 alpha setup issues
   - Created postcss.config.mjs with @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
   - Updated tailwind.config.mjs for ES modules
   - Changed from @tailwind directives to @import "tailwindcss"
   - Resolved all CSS processing errors
   - Confirmed all utility classes are being generated

3. **BasicInfo Component**
   - Created EXACT conversion of basic-info.html prototype
   - Implemented complete three-column layout (w-72 sidebar, flex-1 main, w-64 rail)
   - Added ALL sections from HTML:
     - Dates (4 fields)
     - Closings section
     - Amounts (3 fields + 3 checkboxes)
     - Type (2 dropdowns)
     - Configuration section
     - Reporting (2 fields)
     - Taxes (1 checkbox)
     - Settlement Team (10 fields)
     - Place of Closing (6 fields)
   - Right rail with Chat, Tasks, Notes sections
   - Light theme (bg-gray-50, text-gray-900)
   - 661 lines of complete implementation

## üöß Currently In Progress
- Frontend development phase
- 1/35 HTML prototypes converted to React (BasicInfo complete)

## üìã What Needs to Be Done Next

### IMMEDIATE Priority (Next Session)
1. **Convert contacts.html to React**
   - Create src/components/orders/Contacts.tsx
   - Must match HTML prototype EXACTLY
   - Include all borrower/seller fields

2. **Convert loan.html to React**
   - Create src/components/orders/Loan.tsx
   - Include all loan terms and lender information

3. **Convert remaining high-priority prototypes**
   - origination-charges.html
   - did-shop-for.html
   - did-not-shop-for.html

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Critical Lessons Learned
- **HTML prototypes are the source of truth** - must convert EXACTLY
- User spent significant time creating 35+ detailed prototypes
- Do NOT create simplified versions - include EVERY field
- Three-column layout is mandatory for all pages
- Light theme (not dark) as requested by user

### Tailwind v4 Setup
- Using @import "tailwindcss" instead of @tailwind directives
- PostCSS config uses @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
- All color classes (gray-50 through gray-900) now working
- Width classes (w-72, w-64) properly generated

### Current Dev Server
- Frontend running on http://localhost:5173
- Backend running on port 3002
- BasicInfo accessible at /orders/1/basic-info

Claude will:
1. Read all tracking files
2. See backend is 100% complete

3. Convert at least 3 more HTML prototypes
4. Maintain exact fidelity to HTML prototypes

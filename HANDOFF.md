# Session Handoff Document 🤝

**Last Session**: 2025-08-19 23:03 PST
**Session Duration**: ~2 hours
**Progress**: 60% of frontend components complete

## ✅ What Was Accomplished This Session

### Current Session (21:00-23:03 PST)
1. **Completed Fourth and Fifth Batch of Components**
   - CashToClose component - cash to close calculations with loan estimate comparisons
   - LoanTerms component - loan term configurations with balloon payment and issue dates
   - ProjectedPayments component - payment projections with toggles for tax/insurance
   - LoanCalculations component - APR and TIP calculations with toggle states
   - LoanDisclosures component - comprehensive disclosures with expandable sections
   - ClosingDisclosure component - 6-page legal document viewer with navigation

2. **Smart Solution to Timeout Issue**
   - ClosingDisclosure HTML was 1090 lines, causing API timeouts
   - Implemented incremental building approach:
     - Created base structure first
     - Added pages one at a time using Edit/MultiEdit
     - Successfully avoided all timeouts
   - Full document viewer with print/export functionality

3. **Progress Update**
   - 21/34 components now complete (60% of frontend conversion)
   - All components integrated with AppRoutes.tsx
   - Development server stable throughout session

### Previous Sessions Summary
- Backend 100% complete with PostgreSQL, auth, CRUD API
- AppShell with complete navigation sidebar
- 21 total components converted from HTML prototypes
- All maintaining exact HTML fidelity with dark theme

## 🚧 Currently In Progress
- Frontend development phase
- 21/34 components complete (60%)
- Development server running on port 5173
- Backend on port 3002

## 📋 What Needs to Be Done Next

### IMMEDIATE Priority (Next Session)
1. **Continue converting HTML prototypes to React**
   Next components to convert (in order):
   - settlement-statement.html → src/components/orders/SettlementStatement.tsx (NEXT)
   - debits-credits.html → src/components/orders/DebitsCredits.tsx
   - documents.html → src/components/orders/Documents.tsx
   - accounting.html → src/components/orders/Accounting.tsx
   - dashboard.html → src/components/Dashboard.tsx
   
2. **All components must**:
   - Work with AppShell (no duplicate sidebar)
   - Use dark theme (bg-gray-900)
   - Include ALL form fields from HTML prototype
   - Support proper array indexing (line_01, line_02, etc.)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Smart Approach for Large Components
- If HTML prototype > 500 lines, use incremental approach:
  1. Create base structure with placeholders
  2. Add content sections one at a time
  3. Use MultiEdit for batch updates
- This prevents API timeouts successfully

### Critical Reminders
- HTML prototypes are source of truth - convert EXACTLY
- Three-column layout provided by AppShell
- Components return main content + right rail only
- DARK THEME (bg-gray-900) is standard
- All data-schema-key attributes must be preserved

## 💡 Context for Next Session

When starting the next Claude session, type:
```
continue garden
```

Claude will:
1. Read all tracking files
2. See 21/34 components complete (60%)
3. Continue with settlement-statement.html conversion
4. Use incremental approach if needed for large files

## 📊 Current State Summary

- **Backend**: ✅ COMPLETE (100%)
  - PostgreSQL with JSONB
  - Authentication system
  - Full CRUD API
  - 12 endpoints working
  
- **Frontend**: 🟡 IN PROGRESS (60%)
  - 21/34 components complete
  - All complex forms and calculations working
  - 6-page document viewer implemented
  - Navigation and routing complete

## 🎯 Session Goals for Next Time

1. Convert settlement-statement.html (likely large, use incremental)
2. Convert debits-credits.html
3. Convert documents.html
4. Target: 24/34 components complete (70% of frontend)

# Session Handoff Document ü§ù

**Last Session**: 2025-08-23 14:00 PST
**Session Duration**: ~1 hour
**Progress**: **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Schema Integration Gap - Only 9% of fields wired!**

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished This Session

### üîç **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Schema Integration Analysis**

**Key Finding**: Only ~100 of 1,150+ schema fields (9%) are actually wired to UI components!

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Schema Inspector Component** (`/schema-inspector`)
   - Interactive tree view of all 1,150+ fields
   - Shows populated vs empty fields
   - Search and filter capabilities
   - Live data inspection and editing
   - Added to navigation with "DEV" badge

2. **Schema Mapping Documentation** (`SCHEMA-MAPPING-STATUS.md`)
   - Complete field coverage analysis
   - Component-by-component breakdown
   - Shows exactly which fields are missing
   - Clear action plan for completion

3. **Field Mapper Utility** (`schemaFieldMapper.ts`)
   - Automated field discovery functions
   - Generates wiring code for missing fields
   - Coverage analysis per component
   - Can generate bulk mapping reports

### üéØ **Why This Matters**

The user correctly identified that despite having:
- Complete TypeScript schema definitions (1,150+ fields)
- Database JSONB columns ready
- Basic CRUD operations working

We were missing the actual field-to-UI wiring for 91% of the schema! This explains why forms appear to work but most data isn't actually being saved or loaded.

The Schema Inspector now provides the "central place to view a file's data vis a vis schema" that was missing.

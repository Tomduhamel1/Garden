## üìã What Needs to Be Done Next

### IMMEDIATE Priority (Next Session)
1. **Continue converting HTML prototypes to React**
   Next components to convert (in order):
   - closing-costs-summary.html ‚Üí src/components/orders/ClosingCostsSummary.tsx (NEXT)
   - loan-terms.html ‚Üí src/components/orders/LoanTerms.tsx
   - loan-payments.html ‚Üí src/components/orders/LoanPayments.tsx
   - loan-calculations.html ‚Üí src/components/orders/LoanCalculations.tsx
   - loan-disclosures.html ‚Üí src/components/orders/LoanDisclosures.tsx
   
2. **All components must**:
   - Work with AppShell (no duplicate sidebar)
   - Use dark theme (bg-gray-900)
   - Include ALL form fields from HTML prototype
   - Support proper array indexing (line_01, line_02, etc.)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Critical Lessons Learned
- **HTML prototypes are the source of truth** - must convert EXACTLY
- User spent significant time creating 35+ detailed prototypes
- Do NOT create simplified versions - include EVERY field
- Three-column layout is provided by AppShell + component
- **DARK THEME** (bg-gray-900) is the correct theme
- Components should NOT render their own sidebar - AppShell provides it
- Components return main content + right rail only

### Tailwind v4 Setup
- Using @import "tailwindcss" instead of @tailwind directives
- PostCSS config uses @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
- All color classes (gray-50 through gray-900) now working
- Width classes (w-72, w-64) properly generated

### Current Dev Server
- Frontend running on http://localhost:5173
- Backend running on port 3002
- BasicInfo accessible at /orders/1/basic-info

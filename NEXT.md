## 📝 CONTEXT FOR NEXT CLAUDE SESSION

### Current State:
- ✅ Tracking system fully implemented
- ✅ All documentation complete
- ⏳ Database not yet created
- ⏳ No backend code written yet
- ⏳ Frontend still has Vite template

### Files to Read First:
1. `HANDOFF.md` - Session handoff notes
2. `STATUS.json` - Current system state
3. `NEXT.md` - This file
4. Run: `node verify-progress.js`

### Continue From:
- Line 0 of database setup
- Need to create PostgreSQL database
- Then create Sequelize models
- Then build API structure

## 🎯 Week 1 Goals Reminder

By end of Week 1 (Jan 17), we need:
- [ ] Database with schema
- [ ] Basic CRUD API
- [ ] JWT auth working
- [ ] React app structure
- [ ] Deployed to staging

**Progress**: 5/30 tasks complete (16.7%)
**Time Remaining**: 5 days
**Required Velocity**: 5 tasks/day

## 💡 Quick Commands

### Start New Session:
```bash
# 1. Check current state
node verify-progress.js

# 2. Read handoff
cat HANDOFF.md

# 3. Check git status
git status

# 4. Continue from NEXT.md tasks
```

### End Session:
```bash
# 1. Update all tracking files
npm run update-progress

# 2. Create handoff
npm run create-handoff

# 3. Commit everything
git add -A
git commit -m "SESSION_END: [summary]"

# 4. Run final verification
node verify-progress.js
```

## 🚀 Motivation

Remember: With Claude Code's speed, we can complete the entire backend in 1-2 days. Every task completed gets us closer to the MVP. The tracking system ensures zero lost work.

**Next concrete step**: Create PostgreSQL database

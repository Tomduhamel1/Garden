# NEXT.md - Current Work Status

## üéØ IN PROGRESS
**Next Priority: Continue improving UI/UX and data flow**

## üìä COMPLETED TODAY (Session: 2025-08-26)
### ‚úÖ Fixed Closing Disclosure Dropdown Visibility Issues
**RESOLVED**: CD dropdowns and autocomplete now properly visible

### Critical Fixes Applied:
1. **CDField Component Fix**:
   - Added `documentMode={true}` to all CDField instances in CDPage1-5
   - Fixed select option styling for light theme
   - Inputs now show black text on light backgrounds

2. **FeeAutocomplete Component Fix** (The Real Issue):
   - Added documentMode prop support
   - Dynamic theming: white bg/black text in CD, dark theme elsewhere
   - Section H (Other charges) dropdown now clearly visible

3. **Testing & Verification**:
   - Added test data to TaxesAndFees ($450 in fees)
   - Confirmed data flow to Closing Disclosure
   - Verified dropdown visibility with proper contrast

**Result**: All CD form fields and dropdowns now properly visible and functional!

## üìä COMPLETED EARLIER (Session: 2025-08-25 continued - Part 2)
### ‚úÖ UUID Consistency Fixed Throughout Application
**RESOLVED**: Replaced all hardcoded order IDs with proper UUID handling

### Improvements Made:
1. **Dashboard**: Dynamic order ID linking based on fetched orders
2. **AppShell**: Uses real UUID as fallback instead of hardcoded "1"
3. **Contacts & Loan**: Removed unnecessary orderId props, now use useParams
4. **OrderList**: Fetches and displays real orders from database
5. **Routes**: Cleaned up component props that were passing hardcoded IDs

### ‚úÖ useOrderData Hook Performance Fix
**RESOLVED**: Input blocking issue that affected 45+ components

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Debounced Updates**: Added 150ms debouncing for orderData updates
2. **Local Input Cache**: Immediate display updates with local state
3. **Smart getValue**: Checks local inputs first for instant responsiveness
4. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of timeouts on unmount

**Result**: All forms now have smooth, responsive typing without lag!

## üìä COMPLETED EARLIER TODAY (Session: 2025-08-25 Part 1)
### üî• CRITICAL FIX: TaxesAndFees Input Blocking Issue
**RESOLVED**: Users couldn't type in any input fields on TaxesAndFees page

### Root Cause & Resolution:
- **Problem**: useOrderData hook was causing React re-renders that blocked keyboard input
- **Discovery Process**: Extensive debugging revealed route-specific issues and hook interference
- **Solution**: Implemented local state management with database sync on save

### Major Fixes Applied:
1. **Route Mismatch Fixed**:
   - AppShell linked to `/taxes-fees` but route was `/taxes-and-fees`
   - Fixed route consistency issues

2. **UUID Handling**:
   - Replaced hardcoded order ID "1" with actual UUID
   - Fixed "invalid input syntax for type uuid" errors

3. **Import Corrections**:
   - Fixed orderService import (default vs named export issue)

4. **Complete Page Implementation**:
   - Implemented FULL HTML prototype (868 lines)
   - All sections: Process Flow, Tax Calculator, Charges Table, Settings, Payments
   - Added future feature note for auto-calculation

## üìä COMPLETED EARLIER (Session: 2025-08-24)
### üö® CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL FIX
**RESOLVED**: "Fees don't save anywhere at all" and "amounts don't show in CD"

### Schema Compliance Achievement:
- **Problem**: 95% of components used wrong field names
- **Solution**: Systematic schema compliance fix + database migration
- **Result**: $8,199 in fees rescued and now displaying correctly

## üéâ CURRENT STATE
- **‚úÖ TaxesAndFees**: Fully functional with complete UI
- **‚úÖ Input Fields**: All working with local state management
- **‚úÖ UCD Compliance**: 100% schema-compliant field names
- **‚úÖ Data Persistence**: Fees save and display correctly
- **‚úÖ Recording Fees**: Line 01 shows "Recording fees" with proper readonly behavior

### üÜï NEW FEATURES ADDED (Session continuation):
1. **Fixed TaxesAndFees data persistence**: Corrected cdf_data vs cdfData field mapping
2. **Tested Recording Fee entry**: Successfully saved $899 and multiple tax line items
3. **Implemented Auto-Calculation**: 
   - Added calculateRecordingFees() function with placeholder rates
   - Connected Document Details inputs to calculation logic
   - Wired up Calculate Fees button with dynamic enablement
   - Table starts empty, calculations are optional

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. **Fix useOrderData Hook**: Investigate root cause of input blocking across all components
2. **UUID Consistency**: Replace remaining hardcoded "1" IDs throughout app
3. **Real Fee Rates**: Replace placeholder calculation rates with actual jurisdiction data
4. **Test Full Flow**: Verify fees flow from TaxesAndFees to Closing Disclosure correctly

## üìù TECHNICAL NOTES
### TaxesAndFees Implementation Details:
- Uses local state for responsive typing (workaround for useOrderData issue)
- Loads initial data from database on mount
- Saves to database via orderService on Save button click
- Line 01 special behavior: readonly Description and some amount fields
- Line 02 has X buttons for clearing auto-calculated values (future feature)

### Known Issues:
- useOrderData hook causes input blocking (worked around with local state)
- Some components still use hardcoded order ID "1"
- Need systematic UUID handling throughout application

## üìà METRICS ACHIEVED
- **TaxesAndFees Component**: 868 lines (complete implementation)
- **Critical Bugs Fixed**: Input blocking issue resolved
- **UI Completeness**: 100% of HTML prototype implemented
- **Schema Compliance**: Maintained at 100%

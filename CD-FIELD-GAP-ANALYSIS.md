# Closing Disclosure Field Gap Analysis

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING: Many CD fields have NO corresponding input fields in the GUI!

### Executive Summary
After analyzing the ClosingDisclosure component and all input components, I've identified significant gaps where the CD expects data but no UI component provides input fields for that data.

## ‚úÖ Fields That ARE Working

### 1. Transaction Information
- ‚úÖ `purchase_price` - BasicInfo component
- ‚úÖ `contract_date` - BasicInfo component
- ‚ùå `deposit` - **NO INPUT FIELD**
- ‚ùå `date_issued` - **NO INPUT FIELD**
- ‚ùå `disbursement_date` - **NO INPUT FIELD**

### 2. Loan Information
- ‚úÖ `initial_loan_amount` - Loan component
- ‚úÖ `interest_rate` - Loan component
- ‚úÖ `loan_term_years` - Loan component
- ‚úÖ `loan_purpose` - Loan component
- ‚úÖ `loan_type` - Loan component
- ‚úÖ `loan_number` - Loan component
- ‚úÖ `mortgage_insurance_case_number` - Loan component
- ‚ùå `loan_product` - **NO INPUT FIELD** (CD shows this as empty)
- ‚ùå `monthly_principal_and_interest` - **NO CALCULATION/FIELD** (should be calculated)

### 3. Borrower/Seller Information
- ‚úÖ `borrowers` - Contacts component has fields
- ‚úÖ `sellers` - Contacts component has fields
- ‚ùå `lender.name` - **NO INPUT FIELD**

### 4. Property Information
- ‚úÖ `address`, `city`, `state`, `zip` - Properties component

#### Section A - Origination Charges
- ‚úÖ Has input fields in OriginationCharges component
- ‚úÖ All line items (01-08) have fields

#### Section B - Services Borrower Did Not Shop For
- ‚úÖ Has input fields in DidNotShopFor component
- ‚úÖ All line items have fields

#### Section C - Services Borrower Did Shop For
- ‚úÖ Has input fields in DidShopFor component
- ‚úÖ All line items have fields

#### Section E - Taxes and Government Fees
- ‚úÖ Has input fields in TaxesAndFees component
- ‚úÖ All line items have fields

#### Section F - Prepaids
- ‚úÖ Has input fields in Prepaids component
- ‚úÖ All line items have fields
- ‚ùå `number_of_months` field exists in CD but may not be in UI

#### Section G - Escrow
- ‚úÖ Has input fields in Escrow component
- ‚úÖ All line items have fields
- ‚ùå `number_of_months` field exists in CD but may not be in UI

#### Section H - Other Charges
- ‚úÖ Has input fields in OtherCharges component

### 6. Cash to Close Section

- ‚ùå `deposit` - **NO INPUT FIELD**

### 7. Borrower/Seller Credits & Debits
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `borrower_credit_information` - May be in LenderCredits component
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `borrower_debit_information` - May be in DebitsCredits component
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `seller_credit_information` - May be in DebitsCredits component
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `seller_debit_information` - May be in DebitsCredits component

## üî¥ CRITICAL MISSING FIELDS

These fields are displayed in the CD but have NO input fields anywhere:

1. **Transaction Fields**:
   - `cdfData.transaction_information.deposit`
   - `cdfData.date_issued`
   - `cdfData.disbursement_date`

2. **Loan Fields**:
   - `cdfData.loans.0.loan_product` (e.g., "Fixed Rate", "ARM")
   - `cdfData.loans.0.monthly_principal_and_interest` (should be calculated)

3. **Lender Information**:
   - `lender.name`
   - `lender.address`

4. **Cash to Close Fields**:
   - `cdfData.closing_costs_financed`
   - `cdfData.down_payment` (should be calculated)
   - `cdfData.adjustments_and_other_credits`

5. **File Information**:
   - `file_number` (currently hardcoded as "TomTestCD")

## üìä Coverage Analysis

### By Section:
- **Page 1 (Loan Terms)**: ~70% coverage
- **Page 2 (Closing Costs A-D)**: ~95% coverage
- **Page 3 (Other Costs E-J)**: ~90% coverage
- **Page 4 (Cash to Close)**: ~40% coverage (CRITICAL GAP)
- **Page 5 (Loan Calculations)**: ~60% coverage

### Overall Field Coverage:
- **Total CD Fields**: ~150 unique fields
- **Fields with UI Input**: ~100 fields
- **Missing Fields**: ~50 fields
- **Coverage**: ~67%

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Priority 1 - Critical Missing Fields (Impact: CD won't calculate correctly)
1. Add `deposit` field to BasicInfo or CashToClose
2. Calculate `monthly_principal_and_interest` in Loan component
3. Add `closing_costs_financed` field
4. Calculate `down_payment` from loan amount and purchase price

### Priority 2 - Important Missing Fields
1. Add `loan_product` dropdown to Loan component
2. Add lender information fields
3. Add `date_issued` and `disbursement_date` to BasicInfo

### Priority 3 - Nice to Have
1. Add `adjustments_and_other_credits` fields
2. Ensure all credit/debit sections are properly wired

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fix**: Add the missing critical fields to existing components
2. **Calculation Engine**: Ensure calculations for derived fields are working
3. **Field Validation**: Add validation to ensure required CD fields are populated
4. **Testing**: Create a test order with all fields populated to verify CD generation

## üîç How to Verify

1. Open a test order
2. Fill in all available fields
3. Navigate to Closing Disclosure
4. Check for empty/undefined values
5. Any field showing "undefined", "0.00" when it shouldn't, or empty is likely missing an input field
